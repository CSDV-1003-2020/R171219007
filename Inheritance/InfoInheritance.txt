                                                  Inheritance In C++

The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. 
Inheritance is one of the most important feature of Object Oriented Programming.
Sub Class: The class that inherits properties from another class is called Sub class or Derived Class.
Super Class: The class whose properties are inherited by sub class is called Base Class or Super class.

Syntax:
class subclass_name : access_mode base_class_name
{
  // Body Of Subclass
};

                                                Modes Of Inheritance

1. Public Mode: If we derive a sub class from a public base class.
   Then the public member of the base class will become public in the
   derived class and protected members of the base class will become protected in derived class.

2. Protected Mode: If we derive a sub class from a Protected base class.
   Then both public member and protected members of the base class will become protected in derived class.

3. Private Mode: If we derive a sub class from a Private base class.
   Then both public member and protected members of the base class will become Private in derived class.

Note: The private members in the base class cannot be directly accessed in the derived class, 
      while protected members can be directly accessed. For example, Classes B, C and D all contain 
      the variables x, y and z in below example. It is just question of access.

For Example :
// C++ Implementation to show that a derived class 
// doesn’t inherit access to private data members.  
// However, it does inherit a full parent object

class A  
{ 
public: 
    int x; 
protected: 
    int y; 
private: 
    int z; 
}; 
  
class B : public A 
{ 
    // x is public 
    // y is protected 
    // z is not accessible from B 
}; 
  
class C : protected A 
{ 
    // x is protected 
    // y is protected 
    // z is not accessible from C 
}; 
  
class D : private A    // 'private' is default for classes 
{ 
    // x is private 
    // y is private 
    // z is not accessible from D 
};
